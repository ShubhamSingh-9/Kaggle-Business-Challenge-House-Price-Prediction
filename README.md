### Predicting Property Prices with Linear Regression

Recently, I participated in a Kaggle competition where I used linear regression to predict property prices. In this post, I will share my experience with the project, the tools and libraries I used, and some tips for future learning.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to use linear regression to predict the sale price of residential homes in a given area. The dataset provided contained various features of the properties, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage, as well as information on the location and age of the homes.
I used pandas to manipulate and clean the data, and scikit-learn for training and testing my model. I used a Regressor class from scikit-learn to build my linear regression model.

## Model Performance
After training my model and testing it on a holdout dataset, I achieved a score of 80%. While I was satisfied with this result, I know that there is always room for improvement. In particular, I would like to explore more advanced feature engineering techniques, and experiment with different types of models, such as decision trees and random forests.

## Learning Points
This project taught me a lot about the process of data cleaning, feature selection, and model training. Some of the key takeaways for me were:
1)	Data cleaning is crucial. In order to build an accurate model, it's important to ensure that the data is clean and free of errors.
2)	Feature selection is an art. Choosing the right features to include in your model can be a difficult task. It's important to consider not only the correlation between each feature and the target variable, but also the relationships between features themselves.
3)	Model selection is not one-size-fits-all. Different models may perform better on different types of data. It's important to experiment with different models to find the best one for your specific problem.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. I was able to build a linear regression model to predict property prices with reasonable accuracy, and I gained valuable insights into the data cleaning and model selection process. I look forward to continuing to explore these topics and further developing my skills as a data scientist.
